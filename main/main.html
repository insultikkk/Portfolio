    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate student from Tajikistan, committed to solving real-world problems through physics and engineering. I earned a bronze medal at the International Physics Olympiad and have led national teams in both competitions and mentorship. I'm currently working on sustainable energy solutions through hands-on engineering projects and teaching others to raise the scientific flag of our nation higher.

    <h3>EasyDoorEnergy (EDE)</h3>
    <p>
      A low-cost energy generator that uses electromagnetic induction with door motion. Built using magnets, a plastic pipe, and a coil, it produces small-scale electricity for rural homes. Developed with guidance from my physics teacher at LFGS.
      <br/><strong>Keywords:</strong> Electromagnetic Induction, Sustainable Technology, DIY Device, Renewable Energy
    </p>

    <h3>EasyLightEnergy (ELE)</h3>
    <p>
      A portable and practical solution for lighting in remote or tourist areas, based on oscillating magnet and coil design. It helps address energy access issues in Tajikistan using cost-effective, innovative hardware.
      <br/><strong>Keywords:</strong> Microgeneration, Rural Electrification, Educational Engineering, Magnet-Based Generator
